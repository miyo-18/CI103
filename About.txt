Abstract:
     Unite is a website which acts as a platform for Drexel students to interact
as well as to buy and sell unwanted items. At the end of each quarter or semester, 
most students typically have unwanted furniture that they either throw away or have
to store for a large amount of money. We created a platform to solve this issue and
allow students to post to inform others of the sale. The website also provides a place
to allow students to post notices or questions in general. We value quality, efficiency, 
and reliability, and want to provide our users with an aesthetically pleasing, user 
friendly intuitive interface that allows for quick and easy posting.
     There will be a forum for students to ask questions about anything from 
help with homework to where the best places to eat are. As well as a private messaging system.
     Another aspect of this product is that it will be targeted to university students 
in the Philadelphia area. In order to verify the users, an email will be sent out to make 
sure they signed up with a valid email address
