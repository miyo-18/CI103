# CI103
Coursework for CI103 (Computing and Informatics Design III), Spring 2019, Drexel University <br />
<br />
The purpose of this class was to build off of the prototype website created in CI102 (<a href="https://github.com/miyo-18/CI102">see CI102 repository</a>). My group for this class slightly changed from CI102. The group this time had four members: myself, Harrison Beerley, Andrew Shoffler, and Erica Chen. The goal of this class was to create a finished website that would allow students at Drexel University to to communicate with one another through forums and private messaging in order to buy and sell unwanted goods (furniture and textbooks), ask for homework help, and to post about various upcoming events. <br />
<br />
This repository contains the files used for our website. We used Django and python to create the core of our website, and Heroku to host the website and the database. Here is our <a href="https://unite-site.herokuapp.com/">final website</a>. You can also view the video in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jeKleFhN81CiGVK-Zeev0NAZbV5n60M1zGqMoepng-s/edit#slide=id.g589a60632e_2_25">google slides presentation</a> to get an overview of the functions of our website. <br />
<br />
For this project, I was a developer. I worked primarily on the features related to account creation and email authentication.
